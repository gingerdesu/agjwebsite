      <p data_temp_dwid="1">Founders - Illinois entrepreneurs is a student organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign supporting on campus student startup efforts focusing on entrepreneurship, networking, and education. The organization hosts various events such as 54 Startup Weekend, Forge | Chicago, Startup Career Fair, Jump Genesis, and more. This year, I joined Founders as the community team member to promote Founders within the local student community. </p>
      <h4>54 Startup weekend</h4>

      <p>54 was a 3 day event for students from different backgrounds to come together and launch successful startups. I created the Facebook profile frames for the participants and organizers to promote the event throughout Facebook. The words were layered on top of solid blocks for the words to stand out more from the background, in case people choose pictures with more busy backgrounds. I also created a Snapchat filter with a similar theme for the participants throughout the event. </p>

      <p>Forge Startup Weekend is a 2 day startup conference in Chicago connecting the most innovative students around the midwest to spark a dialogue on how we can move forward with breakthroughs in every field of entrepreneurship.  </p>
