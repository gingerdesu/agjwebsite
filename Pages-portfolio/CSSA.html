      <p>Chinese student Scholars Association is the biggest student organization for international Chinese students on campus, hosting multiple large scale shows, career fairs, and networking events on campus and in Chicago. During my time as the publicity coordinator, I produced the logo of the organization, multiple promotional products for events, and conducted interviews and editting for their performances. </p>
		<h4>CSSA logo</h4>

      <p>The logo was in the shape of two dragons, with the concept of "二龙戏珠", which is one of the traditional elements used for royalties since the Qing Dynasty. The body of the two intertwining dragons also form the words CSSA. </p>

      <p>CSSA has been focused a lot more on the large body of international Chinese students on campus. Starting 2015, the Publicity department at CSSA was aiming to reach more Chinese American students on campus, and as the Publicity coordinator, I ran the Facebook page and produced the promotional graphics for all events published on Facebook. To make the posts more relatable for the non-Chinese speaking audience, I translated the original Wechat and Weibo scripts into English. We were able to connect with Asian American Association, Korean Student Association, Vietnamese Student Association, and other organizations and have a lot of attendance from other organizations.
